# Vision Physiology Software

> *An integrated software for cellular and network physiology of visual circuits in behaving mice*

--------------------

The software is organized into several modules to perform the acquisition, the preprocessing, the standardization, the visualization, the analysis and the sharing of multimodal neurophysiological recordings.

The different modules are detailed in the [documentation below](README.md#modules-and-documentation) and their integration is summarized on the drawing below:

</p>


--------------------

## Install

Simply:
```
pip install physion
```

N.B. the `PyQt` package can be broken after those steps, re-start from a fresh install with `pip uninstall PyQt5` and `pip install PyQt5`.

**For an installation on an acquisition setup, see the detailed steps in [docs/install/README.md](./docs/install/README.md)**

## Usage

Run:
```
python -m physion
```

You will find some pre-defined shortcuts in the [utils/](./src/utils/) folder for different operating systems.

N.B. The program is launched in either "analysis" (by default) or "acquisition" mode. This insures that you can launch several analysis instances while you record with one acquisition instance of the program. To launch the acquisition mode, run: `python -m physion acquisition`.
